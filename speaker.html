                    Esther is currently Venmo’s Lead Product Marketer, working on the launching the Venmo debit card (currently in beta). After graduating from Wellesley in ’09 with a degree in Economics, she earned her MBA at Wharton and worked as a Business Analyst at McKinsey. When Esther joined Venmo in 2013, it was a small startup of about 30 full time employees, and few people had heard of Venmo. Today, Venmo processes over a billion dollars each month. Esther feels very lucky to have worked on a product that went viral, but she and her team have experienced —at the company level and at a personal level. At her fireside chat at WHACK, Esther will share what it's like to make tough decisions in a fast paced environment, and how to thrive as a woman in tech.

                  <p class="speaker-time" style="margin-bottom:5px">🗓 Saturday Nov. 11th 4:00-5:00pm @ Lulu Cow Chair Room
                  <p class="text-stories">
                    Last year, Lisa van Gelder was interviewing for a new executive job in NYC at the same time as two (white, male) friends. Because they had a similar amount of experience and similar interests, they ended up interviewing at the same companies at the same time, and Lisa found herself in an unintentional A/B test. When they compared notes, she found that she had a radically different interview experience than her friends. Lisa discusses what she learned from her accidental A/B tests, how the term “unqualified” is often used to reject marginalised groups in tech, and what we can do about it, as interviewees looking for a new job and as allies.
                    Lisa lives in Brooklyn, New York, and is VP of Engineering at Meetup, a website that connects over 32 million people in 182 countries with others around them who share similar interests. Lisa has working in software for over 17 years now, since she started building websites in 1999 and found backend problems were way more fun. She is a board member of Write/Speak/Code, a non profit whose mission is to level up women and nonbinary software developers through blogging, public speaking and open source software.
